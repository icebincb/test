#### Steps to reproduce

> For issues related to a specific 3D model try to identify which are the features of the model that cause the issue, or at least attach as a ZIP archive a very simple (lightweight) 3D model that has the same problem. If this is not possible you can send that model via e-mail to <gpv.code@gmail.com> with a subject starting with "*[AsImpL] 3D model-*", then you can create a related issue.

> For general bugs, attempt to recreate the issue with a simple example code and provide steps to reproduce if possible. Include code samples, errors and stacktraces if appropriate.

#### Expected behavior

> For general bugs, briefly describe what you expect should happen.

#### Current behavior

> For general bugs, briefly describe what is actually happening.
